### ~~[Infinite Attack, Defense, Health](/RPG-elevator/Scripts/inf-atk-def-health.lua)~~ <sub><sup>`v1.0.0` *(SEMI-PATCHED)*</sup></sub>
Press T to spam equip the beginner necklace and get infinite stats, press T again to stop it. HAVE TO RE-EXECUTE ON JOIN/SPAWN. Currently semi-patched (works for a period of time, before the server does a sanity check and kicks you - working on a workaround) as of *25/03/2023*.

### [Give All Items](/RPG-elevator/Scripts/allitems.lua) <sub><sup>`v1.0.0` *(Updated: 25/03/2023)*</sup></sub>
Execute to get all items in the game, but most are locked behind levels. Also prints all items to the console, so you can use https://v3rmillion.net/showthread.php?pid=8466681#pid8466681 (credit to them) to get individual items. Working as of *25/03/2023*.
